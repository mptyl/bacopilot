1. **What are the primary objectives and overall scope of the project**

The main objective of this software project is to create an application that will allow questionnaires to be displayed on the web for recipients to answer. Access to the questionnaires will be controlled by authentication based on login and password. The answers entered by the recipients will be recorded on the server and will allow the study of certain organisational aspects of the organisation of which the recipients are employees. The strategic objective of the owner, ACME, is to provide its customers with an easy and cost-effective way of gathering the information needed to carry out organisational assessments. The application is called Vega.

2. **What are the key stakeholders, and what are their roles and responsibilities in the project?**

The stakeholders are:
* the Assessors: these are the ACME employees who play the role of creators of the questionnaires and assessors of the organizational characteristics that want to be observed through the questionnaires. Their copitas will be to provide Functional and Non-Functional Requirements, to collaborate during the writing of the code, to test the code created, and finally to assist the recipients who will use it.
* the ACME Managers who will give the project guidelines and verify that it is on budget and on schedule
* ACME's Systems Engineers who will collaborate in getting the application into production.

3. **What are the key deliverables expected from this project?**

The expected deliverables are:
- a web application capable of implementing the required functionalities, which will be detailed during the detailed analysis phase.
- a user documentation that clarifies to Assessors how to use the application
- a technical documentation that clarifies to the Software Engineers the technical problems inherent in the application to be managed in production

4. **What are the expectations of the primary users regarding the system's functionality, performance, and usability?**
the main user expectations are:
- that the questionnaires show in a clear and complete manner all the question types envisaged, both those with closed answers and those with free and open answers
- in the event of an error in the answers, the recipient is helped to recognise the error and to correct himself/herself
- that it is possible to save a questionnaire, even if it is incomplete, in order to be able to resume it later
- that the user interface is pleasant, usable and modern
- that the performance of the system is able to withstand a load of more than 50 recipients at the same time 

5. **Are there any particular needs or constraints related to accessibility, security, or compliance that must be considered?**
There are no particular accessibility, security and compliance issues to consider other than those of any web application with restricted access via authentication

6. **What are the communication plans for each stakeholder group, including frequency, format, and content of updates?**
Each stakeholder will be kept informed through metting every fortnight. Contacts between the Assessors and the developers will be daily, while via Jira and Confluence the progress of the work and the agreed contents can be checked at any time

7. **How will the success of the project be evaluated, and which metrics will be used to assess its impact on stakeholders?**
The success of the project will be assessed first and foremost on the basis of functional completeness. A coefficient of coverage with respect to functional and non-functional requirements may be used as a metric.

8. **Are there any secondary users or beneficiaries of the system, and what are their specific requirements?**
There are no secondary users to take into account, other than feedback from the recipients when the system goes into production.

9. **How do stakeholders prioritize their needs and expectations from the project, and are there any potential conflicts between them?**
There are no potential conflicts between stakeholders.

10. **What ongoing support, training, or maintenance will stakeholders require post-implementation?**
Assessors will need specific training, which can be delivered through web seminars to be recorded for later viewing sccessively.
