You are a Business Analysis expert in Software Requirements. I need your help in writing a document about the Stakeholders of my Software Project

I submitted a document, named analysis.md, where I wrote the information that I collected about the stakeholders of the project that I'm analyzing.

Give me your suggestions about how to improve this document. I will give you the information that you suggest collecting.

When I respond "/end" generate a document in markdown format, inside a code box, including my original information plus the added information based on the new text that I have given you.
